## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I've learned the iportance of consice language. This was one of the most simple projects I have worked on. Instead of overcoplicating it, I should have also used simple words. I didn't need as many div classes as I thought. When it comes to the stats list, I could have used strong. A

Using css grid would have made things easier by keeping it organized. I need to get better at using grid and flexbox properly.

I never worked with color overlays before, so it was a bit of a challenge for me. I was't sure how to remove the purple line for showing.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 .header-image {
    position: relative;
    
    
    #overlay {
        background: $primarycolor-violet;
        overflow: hidden;
        border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
        
    }
    
    img {
        object-fit: cover;
        opacity: 0.5;
        border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
    }
    
    
}
}
```



### Continued development
